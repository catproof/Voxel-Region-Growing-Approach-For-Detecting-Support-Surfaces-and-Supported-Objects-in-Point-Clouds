# Voxel-Region-Growing-Approach-For-Detecting-Support-Surfaces-and-Supported-Objects-in-Point-Clouds
Developed an algorithm which uses voxels and a region-growing technique for detecting support surfaces in point clouds. It is linear both in the number of voxels used and the number of points in the cloud. It uses the results from the support surface detection to detect supported objects using a k-nearest neighbors region-growing algorithm.
